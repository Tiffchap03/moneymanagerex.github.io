Occasionally I would try and use assets and asset accounts but always got confused and gave up.
This time I am determined to succeed, and wish there was a worked example (or even a tutorial) to help.</description></item><item><title>What's behind the increase in release</title><link>https://moneymanagerex.org/blog/whats-behind-the-increase-in-release/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moneymanagerex.org/blog/whats-behind-the-increase-in-release/</guid><description>Money Manager Ex offered a new release every 2-6 weeks since April 2021.

He&amp;rsquo;s made changes to the code almost every day this year and manages releases for macOS.</description></item><item><title>Explanation on Downtime</title><link>https://moneymanagerex.org/blog/explanation-on-downtime/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moneymanagerex.org/blog/explanation-on-downtime/</guid><description>All MMEX users,
Just a short explanation of what happened. Basically, these several hours down was due to the php7.3-fpm down due to some unknown issues. Just restart the service to fix it and will keep an eye on this.
mmex@vps:~$ sudo service php7.3-fpm status ‚óè php7.3-fpm.service - The PHP 7.3 FastCGI Process Manager Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/php7.3-fpm.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: failed (Result: timeout) since Fri 2020-10-30 01:41:02 EDT; 2min 8s ago Docs: man:php-fpm7.</description></item></channel></rss>
