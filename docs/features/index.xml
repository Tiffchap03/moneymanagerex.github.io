What is open source? # The term &amp;ldquo;open source&amp;rdquo; refers to something that can be modified because its design is publicly accessible.
While it originated in the context of computer software development, today the term &amp;ldquo;open source&amp;rdquo; designates a set of values - what we call the open-source way. Open source projects, products, or initiatives are those that embrace and celebrate open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community development.</description></item></channel></rss>
