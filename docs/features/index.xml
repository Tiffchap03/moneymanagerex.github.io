Transactions are divided for each bank account and they could have different status:
Unreconciled: When you enter a transaction, it initially is in the state of &amp;ldquo;Unreconciled&amp;rdquo;. Which means the transaction has not been reconciled with your bank/credit card company&amp;rsquo;s balance.
Reconciled: Once the transaction is checked and verified with a credit card company&amp;rsquo;s balance information, it can be marked as reconciled.</description></item><item><title>Payees &amp; Categories</title><link>https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/features/payees/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/features/payees/</guid><description>Money Manager EX allows assigning to every transaction a payee and one or more categories.
Payees are the people or institutions that give us money, or the people or institutions that we pay, for our goods and services. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to associate a specific category with the payee, in this way it&amp;rsquo;s possible to have the category pre-loaded when inserting new transactions.
A Category is generally used to record Income or Expenses.</description></item><item><title>Scheduled Transactions</title><link>https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/features/scheduled/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/features/scheduled/</guid><description>Money Manager EX allows creating scheduled transactions to track financial activities that occur at once or at regular intervals, such as the payment of a bill or a monthly mortgage.
When one or more schedules are enabled, transactions will be created in your account as by schedules. They are also needed to create cash flow reports with the number of funds available, based on future commitments.
These special transactions:

Stock holdings have been updated to allow money from our general accounts to be transferred to and from our investment accounts. This also allows the payment of dividends to be recorded against our stock holdings. To facilitate this, a share account is created when we add a new stock (would re-use the investment account).</description></item><item><title>Assets</title><link>https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/features/assets/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/features/assets/</guid><description>Money Manager EX allows tracking fixed assets like cars, houses, land, and others.
Each asset can have its value appreciate by a certain rate per year, depreciate by a certain rate per year, or not change in value. The total assets are added to your total financial worth.</description></item><item><title>Budgeting</title><link>https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/features/budgeting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/features/budgeting/</guid><description>Money Manager EX allows you to set up a budget for a year and/or a month.

All attachments are copied into a user-defined folder and not simply linked to the original file: in this way, they will remain accessible also if the original files are removed and it&amp;rsquo;s possible to backup all of them by simply copying the entire folder.
Bring Your Own Cloud could synchronize these attachments and database files across all your devices,</description></item><item><title>General Reports</title><link>https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/features/generalreports/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/features/generalreports/</guid><description>Money Manager EX allows to create custom and heavy personalized report without external tools but using an internal templating engine.

Supported formats are:
QIF (Quicken Interchange Format) CSV (Comma-Separated Values) HTML (HyperText Markup Language) XML (Extensible Markup Language) To alleviate the problem of users having to pre-format their bank transaction CSV files into the fixed format that software requires, MMEX allows users to import CSV files where the order of fields is completely freeform. To use this importer, select the order of fields in the CSV file by picking and choosing from the list of possible fields.</description></item></channel></rss>
