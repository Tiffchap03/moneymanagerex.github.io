Money Manager EX allows to create custom and heavy personalized report without external tools but using an internal templating engine.

It's possible to obtain a report that suits to a T with:
- SQL queries to obtain needed data from the database
- LUA code to modify and add some logic to the selected date
- HTML/CSS/JS to show data with preferred style

We have created a [repository on Github](https://www.moneymanagerex.org/component/weblinks/weblink/31-reports/22-github-report-repository?Itemid=435&task=weblink.go) and a [forum section](https://www.moneymanagerex.org/component/weblinks/weblink/31-reports/23-forum-report-repository?Itemid=435&task=weblink.go) with lots of examples and discussions on how to develop and improve them.
