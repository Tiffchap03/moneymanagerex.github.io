You are not tied to a cloud provider. 

You can store your database files using your chosen 
- public cloud provider
    - Google, Microsoft, DropBox, etc.
- private cloud provider
    - NextCloud, Synology NAS, etc
- local storage + sync tools
  - Synching, etc

Once the BYOC is set up on all your devices:
For Desktop MMEX
- Just locate your database on the shared area provided by your cloud provider.
- the BYOC looks after synchronizing the data to the cloud.

For Android MMEX
-  Open or create your database on the shared area provided by your cloud provider.
-  Enable Synchronization via `main menu -> Settings -> Synchronization`.
    - interval as 5min and sync on start checked.
