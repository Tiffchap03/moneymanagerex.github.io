## **Overview**

Money Manager EX (MMEX) provides a comprehensive way to **track and manage fixed assets** such as **real estate, vehicles, collectibles, and investments**. These assets are included in your total **net worth**, helping you maintain a complete financial picture.

## **Key Features**

- **Track fixed assets separately** from bank accounts and cash balances.
- **Automate value changes** with appreciation or depreciation rates.
- **Manually revalue assets** at any time to reflect market adjustments.
- **Include assets in net worth calculations** for a more accurate financial overview.

## **Asset Value Management**

MMEX allows asset values to be adjusted in three ways:

1. **Automatic Appreciation** â€“ Increase value annually (e.g., real estate growth).
2. **Automatic Depreciation** â€“ Reduce value over time (e.g., car depreciation).
3. **Manual Revaluation** â€“ Update the asset value manually at any time to reflect current market conditions.

To manually revalue an asset, simply edit the assetâ€™s value field within MMEX. This ensures your financial records stay aligned with real-world changes.
