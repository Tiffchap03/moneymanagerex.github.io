Money Manager EX is your trusted financial companion, designed to seamlessly manage your finances while ensuring top-notch security for your personal data. By default, all your financial records are stored locally, granting you complete ownership and control.

### Advanced Encryption for Your Data

To safeguard your data, Money Manager EX employs **AES encryption**, a globally recognized standard for secure data protection:

- **Desktop App**: Starting from version **v1.8.1**, the Desktop app now supports **AES256**, enhancing encryption strength and aligning with the Android app for seamless compatibility.
- **Android App**: Utilizes robust **AES256** encryption to protect your data on the go.
- **iOS App**: Encryption support is **TBD**, with plans to bring consistent security standards across all platforms.

This unified adoption of AES256 across platforms ensures better compatibility with **SQLCipher**, further reinforcing the security of your financial records.

### Future-Proofing Security

Looking ahead, we are exploring the integration of **multi-cipher support**, which will allow for even more advanced and adaptable encryption options. This initiative reflects our commitment to continuously improving the security and privacy of your data, offering peace of mind across all devices and platforms.

Your financial security is our priority. With Money Manager EX, you can confidently manage your finances knowing your data is protected by state-of-the-art encryption.
