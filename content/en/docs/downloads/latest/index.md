## Looking for the Android Build?

This can be found via the dedicated [MMEX Android](https://android.moneymanagerex.org/) site.

## Upgrading from v1.4.0?

If you get the database error, "MMEX database version 13 doesn't work with this MMEX version," 
then see [Steps to convert your database from 1.4.x](https://github.com/moneymanagerex/moneymanagerex/issues/2353)

The latest Money Manager Ex release uses the database structure of the 1.3.x series and discontinued the structure of version 1.4.x. 
This maintains compatibility with the mobile app.
