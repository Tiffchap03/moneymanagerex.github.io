Money Manager EX (MMEX) for Android now supports attachment previews, allowing users to view documents, images, and other files associated with their transactions directly on their mobile devices. This guide will help you set up the attachment folder and use the attachment preview feature.

## Setting Up the Attachment Folder

To enable attachment previews, you'll first need to configure where MMEX stores and accesses your attachments. Here's how to set it up:

1. Open the MMEX app and go to `三 -> Settings -> Per-Database -> Attachment Folder`.
2. Choose the location for your attachment folder:
   - **Phone Storage**: Select a local directory on your phone.
   - **Cloud Storage**: If you use cloud services like NextCloud, choose the folder synced to your phone via the cloud app.

3. Once set, MMEX will link to and preview attachments stored in this folder.

## Syncing Attachments

If you're using a cloud storage service like NextCloud, make sure the folder is synced to your device via the app. This ensures that attachments are available for preview within MMEX.

### Enabling Synchronization

Ensure that synchronization is enabled in the MMEX app under `三 -> Settings -> Synchronization` to keep your attachments and data in sync.

## Previewing Attachments

After setting up the folder, any transaction with a linked attachment will display a **Preview** link in its details view. To view the attachment:

1. Open the transaction details.
2. Tap the **Preview** link to open the associated file (e.g., receipts, invoices) using your phone’s default viewer.
